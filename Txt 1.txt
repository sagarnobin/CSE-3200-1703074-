Uncertainty continues in Pakistan over who will form the next government, three days after its elections. While the polls seemed pretty much set to favour Nawaz Sharif-led Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N), which had the backing of the military, voting threw up a surprise, and the final tally — released after much delay amid accusations of rigging — saw independent candidates secure the maximum of 101 seats. Most of these independents are backed by Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), as they were barred from contesting on the party’s symbol by the Election Commission.The PML-N came second with 75 seats, and the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) led by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari stood third with 54 seats. One result has been withheld and another vote was postponed because of a candidate’s death. No bloc is in the position to form a government and the high number of independents has created an unprecedented situation.
