Project Title: Text Summarization using Tranformer-based NLP

Summary:

Nowadays, all of us are required to deal with a huge amount of text data like news, articles,
stories etc. So the importance of a ‘Text Summarizer’ application can’t be denied for the
convenience in our day-to-day life which will summarise a given text into a desired character
limit. In this project, the transformer architecture-based ‘Natural Language Processing’ technique
has been used for text summarisation. A pre-trained transformer model (Google Pegasus) has
been used by ‘Hugging Face’ API and the model is further fine-tuned with a dataset (Samsum
Dataset). This dataset contains summaries of approximately 16k conversations. The target is to
finally develop a web-based application using Streamlit with a user interface where user can
input a certain text and get the desired summary. The web application is hosted on the local
machine. The tools which are used throughout the project are mentioned as follows:

Tools:

1. Language: Python.
2. Python Libraries: Numpy, pandas.
3. Hugging Face API.
4. Google Collab.
5. Transformers Libary: Pytorch, Tensorflow, Tokenizer, ROGUE, Nltk.
6. Web Framework: Streamlit
7. Local server
